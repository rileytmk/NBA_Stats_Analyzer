# NBA_Stats_Analyzer

## Introduction / General Information
I created this project for fun after joining a fantasy basketball league with my friends. For those who aren't familiar with fantasy basketball, it's a competition where participants draft real-life NBA players to create a team. Players earn points based on the stats they achieve in game and the goal is to outscore the competition. As someone who enjoys competition, I had the desire to create a tool that could predict the performance of NBA players in an upcoming game.

Currently, the core functionality of the project is a machine learning model that precicts the amount of points a player will score in their next game based on their past 5 performances. Using the nba_api, I am able to access historical data from nba.com and store it into data frames
